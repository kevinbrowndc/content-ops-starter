          "Kevin worked for the American International School of Lome in two volunteer capacities. He taught in our evening college readiness program. This course focused on high level English and academic skills needed for college. He also designed our entire three level Lab classroom EFL Program for high school students and taught some of the classes himself. He was very professional in his work and also very personal in the sense that students and teachers enjoyed working with him. I would recommend him highly for teaching or for curriculum design."

          “I am blessed and honored to have been a part of the Peace Corps TEFL program under the leadership of Kevin Brown. He turned a large group of young, (mostly) inexperienced volunteers into capable and confident ESL Teachers with the ability to navigate and integrate into a foreign country and their public school system. Kevin worked extremely hard to create an inclusive and supportive work environment for all volunteers- easily reachable, flexible and empowered volunteers to take an active role in shaping and improving the design of our program. I have tremendous respect for Kevin as a supervisor and human being. The technical training before service and the professional feedback throughout my time in Peace Corps help to build my talent and self-assurance as a teacher. I thank Kevin for being a generous and inspiring Program Manager for the TEFL volunteers of Peace Corps, Tico 21. Thank you Kevin!”

He stayed after school with us for about a month, everyday to help us catch up with some work that we would be missing. If it hadn’t been for what he did for us we could lost the credit for that school year. Thanks a lot Mr.Brown!!"

          “As my direct supervisor, Kevin excelled in delegating tasks and managing resources within our project team for the Teaching English as a Foreign Language program in Peace Corps Costa Rica. He formed a great deal of the project from scratch, utilizing and implementing a vast knowledge of English education methodologies and practices. Kevin has also planned and conducted evaluations of the project and program operations throughout the implementation of the TEFL project in Peace Corps Costa Rica by identifying problems and recommending efficiency and effectiveness improvements. Among his duties as program manager and Associate Peace Corps Director, Kevin has effectively and successfully upheld organization and timeliness of reports both nationally and internationally, managed data and statistics from volunteer work reports, and maintained liaison with external entities to the organization, such as the United States Embassy, the Costa Rican Ministry of Education, and many others. Kevin’s contribution to Peace Corps Costa Rica will leave a lasting effect on the organization both in the TEFL project and beyond.”
